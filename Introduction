Subject: Assignment Submission - Joyjit Paul Ayan (ID: 241-15-654)

Dear Ma'am Hasna Hena,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Joyjit Paul Ayan, and I am a student in your course, Section 66_G. My student ID is 241-15-654, and I’m submitting my assignment on the Student Management System for this course.

In this assignment, I’ve worked on creating a system to manage student and course information. It covers tasks like course registration, grade management, and advisor assignments. I used data structures such as Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Maps to build a well-organized system.

Thank you so much for your time, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback you might have. I’m looking forward to the rest of the course and learning more.

Best regards,
Joyjit Paul Ayan
